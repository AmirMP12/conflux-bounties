# Conflux Bounties Program

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Experimental & Non-Production**: All bounty projects and their resulting codebases are provided for educational and community-building purposes. They should be considered experimental and are not intended for use in production environments without further security auditing and refinement.

This repository hosts the Conflux Bounties Program. It provides open-source, well-scoped projects and incentives for developers to build tools, SDKs, integrations, and infrastructure that benefit the Conflux ecosystem.

## How It Works
- Browse and claim bounties in the `bounties/` directory
- Follow clear contribution and submission guidelines in `docs/`
- Collaborate with the community on Discord and GitHub
- Earn rewards for high-quality, open-source contributions
